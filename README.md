# Code Examples

Here are some examples of code written by me, of varying dates from around 2 years ago to just a few months ago. 

Case1, Case2 and Case3 were written in Java for coding exercises/tests, while the others are in C# and made for various different mechanics and effects in games I have been part of developing.
